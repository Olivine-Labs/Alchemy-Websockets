Documentation: [olivinelabs.com/Alchemy-Websockets/](http://olivinelabs.com/Alchemy-Websockets/)

## Usage

Alchemy Websockets is a Visual Studio 2010 project. It can be loaded in the free
Visual C# Express and Monodevelop as well (and potentially other compatible IDEs.)

After compilation, include the dll as a reference into your project. From there,
starting a server is as simple as instantiating an WSServer object, opening the 
connection, and binding events.

An example application can be seen on [alchemy-websockets-example](https://github.com/Olivine-Labs/Alchemy-Websockets-Example)

Example:

```csharp
//...refs
using Alchemy;
using Alchemy.Classes;

static void Main(string[] args)
{
  var aServer = new WSServer(8100, IPAddress.Any)
  {
      DefaultOnReceive = OnReceive,
      DefaultOnSend = OnSend,
      DefaultOnConnect = OnConnect,
      DefaultOnConnected = OnConnected,
      DefaultOnDisconnect = OnDisconnect,
      TimeOut = new TimeSpan(0, 5, 0)
  };

  aServer.Start();
}

static void OnConnected(UserContext aContext)
{
  Console.WriteLine("Client Connection From : " + aContext.ClientAddress.ToString());
}

//...etc
```
